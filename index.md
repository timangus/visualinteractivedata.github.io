The **VisHub** is an interdisciplinary research lab researching creative methods for interactive, exploratory and explanatory data visualizations across domains and environments (e.g., screen, physical, immersion). Our goal is to make data visualiztion and data analytics understandable by everyone. We are based at the [Institute for Design Informatics](https://www.designinformatics.org/) and the [School of Informatics](https://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics) at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk). Our research includes, but is not limited to:

-   data-driven storytelling,
-   visualization education
-   immersive Analytics,
-   network and spatio-temporal visualization,
-   physical visualization,
-   data visualization and NLP

We are heavily involved in co-organizing [Edinburgh's Data Vis Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-vBHbCmgh). [Get in touch with us](mailto:bbach@ed.ac.uk) if you want to become involved. Likewise, every last Friday of the month, we're running a [Chart Clinic](chart-clinic.html) for staff and graduat(e/ing) studnets of the University.
